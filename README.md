# Intro

This Animal Trading Card project was an assignment for my Intro to Programming course at Udacity. It was supposed to showcase the skills that I have 
learned about HTML and CSS programming languages as well as the use of a stylesheet. I loved Pokemon growing up as a kid so I made my trading card based
on a Pokemon trading card.
